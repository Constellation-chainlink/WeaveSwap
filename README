# WeaveSwap: Cross-Chain Swap Application

WeaveSwap is a decentralized cross-chain swap application developed as part of the Chainlink Hackathon. The platform leverages Chainlink technology to enable seamless and secure swapping of assets across different blockchain networks.

## Features

- **Cross-Chain Compatibility:** WeaveSwap supports the exchange of tokens/assets across various blockchain networks, providing users with flexibility and interoperability.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive interface designed to simplify the swapping process for both novice and experienced users.
- **Security:** WeaveSwap prioritizes security, employing industry best practices and smart contract audits to ensure a safe swapping environment.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To run WeaveSwap locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weaveswap.git`
2. Install dependencies: `cd weaveswap && npm install`
3. Configure environment variables (if necessary).
4. Run the application: `npm start`

### Usage

- Access the WeaveSwap platform through the provided interface.
- Connect your wallet (MetaMask, etc.) to the supported blockchain network.
- Select the tokens/assets you want to swap and initiate the transaction.
- Confirm the transaction details and complete the swap.

## Tech Stack

- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity, Chainlink , CCIP
- **Frontend:** Next.js, Redux,Tailwind
- **Backend:** Node.js (or relevant backend technology)
- **Blockchain Networks:** Right now for hackathon purpose we have completed all chains from and to sepolia

Certainly! Here's an improved installation section tailored for your repository structure, including instructions for both the frontend and the smart contracts:

### Installation

#### Frontend

The frontend code resides in the `frontend` folder of this repository.

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend 
   ```

    ```bash
   cd weaveswap-master
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command starts the development server, allowing you to access the WeaveSwap interface at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Smart Contracts

For accessing and working with the smart contracts, follow these steps:

1. **Hardhat Configuration Files:**

   - Smart contracts are located in the `contracts` directory.
   - Hardhat configuration files can be found in the `hardhat` directory.

2. **Install Hardhat and Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have Hardhat installed globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g hardhat
   ```

3. **Compile Smart Contracts:**

   Run the following command to compile the smart contracts:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

4. **Run Tests (Optional):**

   To execute tests, if available:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

5. **Deployment and Interaction:**

   Use Hardhat scripts or deploy scripts provided in the repository to deploy contracts to your preferred network (local, testnet, or mainnet). Update the Hardhat configuration files (`hardhat.config.js`) with the necessary network details.

   For instance, to deploy on a local network:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

   Consult the respective documentation or scripts provided in the repository for specific deployment and interaction commands.

### Usage

Once the frontend and smart contracts are set up and running, access the WeaveSwap interface through your web browser. Ensure you have Metamask or another compatible wallet connected to the supported blockchain network to initiate swaps seamlessly.
